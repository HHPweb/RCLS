	<p><strong>Important Information Regarding Degree Mills</strong><br> 
	Please watch this important video (<a href="http://youtu.be/a1voHNMQDrk">http://youtu.be/a1voHNMQDrk</a>) regarding degree and accreditation mills. According to CHEA, &quot;Degree mills and accreditation mills mislead and harm. In the United States, degrees and certificates from mills may not be acknowledged by other institutions when students seek to transfer or go to graduate school. Employers may not acknowledge degrees and certificates from degree mills when providing tuition assistance for continuing education. &quot;Accreditation&quot; from an accreditation mill can mislead students and the public about the quality of an institution. In the presence of degree mills and accreditation mills, students may spend a good deal of money and receive neither an education nor a useable credential.&quot; Read more on CHEA&apos;s website (<a href="http://www.chea.org/degreemills/">http://www.chea.org/degreemills/</a>).</p>
