	<p>Certificate programs offer students an excellent way to gain additional professional education in very specific areas of study. Typically between 12 and 18 credit hours, certificates may be earned by graduate students only. A notation appears on the student&#39;s academic transcript indicating successful completion of a certificate.</p>
	<p>In the Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies we offer two specialty graduate certificate programs.
