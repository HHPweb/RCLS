	<p>East Carolina University's RT degree program responds to the UNC Strategic Goals and the ECU Mission and Strategic Directions in several ways.</p>

	<h5>Distinguishing Ourselves by the Ability to Educate and Prepare Leaders</h5>

	<p>ECU's RT program is one of the largest professional preparation programs in the United States. Graduates from ECU assume positions as leaders in both the discipline of recreational therapy and in health care service delivery. At the local level, graduates from the recreational therapy program serve as lead therapists in behavioral health at Pitt County Memorial Hospital, and as principals with community mental health providers. At the state and national levels, graduates from the program have served in leadership positions in the North Carolina Recreational Therapy Association, the American Therapeutic Recreation Association, and on the North Carolina Board for Recreational Therapy Licensure. In addition, several graduates have gone on to pursue doctoral degrees from Indiana University, Clemson University, and Penn State University.</p>

	<h5>Creating A Strong, Sustainable Future for Eastern North Carolina through Education, Research, Innovation, Investment, and Outreach</h5>

	<p>The RT degree program faculty and student body are committed to a service learning approach that includes education of professionals and the public, research on health outcomes for consumers and individuals with disabilities, and through outreach via service learning. Faculty are engaged in research activities that address the impacts of recreational therapy on the functional independence measures (FIM) of individuals in rehabilitation settings, the use of psychophysiology in addressing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from war and natural disasters, and impacts of quality mental health for children and youth. In addition, the RT program was selected as a national site for the implementation and verification of a competency based education accreditation system for recreational therapy education and practice.</p>

	<h5>Saving Lives, Curing Diseases, and Positively Transforming Health and Health Care</h5>

	<p>The RT program's focus is on educating professionals to address functional outcomes that promote the community participation and health of individuals with medical conditions and disabilities. Graduates from the program assume positions in a wide range of health care settings including physical rehabilitation, mental health services, programs serving persons with developmental disabilities, long-term care facilities serving the older adult, and in community-based services promoting the inclusion of individuals with disabilities into the life of the community.</li>
